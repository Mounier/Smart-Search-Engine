Smart Search Engine using machine learning 

First, you have to use buildTfidf.py to build the model, it takes a file text in input, each file's raw is a document content.

This is how a raw should be : 
C:\uers\Dupont\point_210916.docx ?*? points suivi reunion contrat validation point ete lundi point adrien mounier emettra validation flux voir validera contenu agit validation comptable validation comptable...

We have two elements in a raw, both separated by "?*?". The first element is the document path, the second the content.

Then you can run the main.py to play with the models.
